Part 1
This part focuses on designing database structures to support many-many relationships as well as 1-many relationships. Your task is to design the database structure for the classes and relationships given below.

Think about what data types to use for each attribute as well as any other tables or columns you need in order to store these relationships.

Imagine an app that allows users to keep track of what films they've seen: films_viewers
workers_shifts
Imagine an app that allows users to keep track of the books they've read: books
Ask an instructor to look over your solution before moving on to Part 2 to make sure you're on the right track.

Part 2
This part is about identifying many-many and 1-many relationships between classes. You will be tasked with first designing the relationships between each given set of classes and then designing a database structure to support them (like you did in Part 1).

Ask an instructor to look over your solution before moving on to Part 3 to make sure you're on the right track.

Part 3
In this part you will be given just the concept of an app and you will have to design the classes, relationships, and database structure for it. You can keep things relatively simple and aim for somewhere around 2-5 classes per app.

A food delivery app that allows users to place orders for dishes from restaurants.

An app that airlines might use to keep track of the flights they have scheduled and who the passengers and crew are on each flight.

A music streaming app that allows artists to post tracks, and for listeners to subscribe to artists.
